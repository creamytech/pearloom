## Sprint paused — awaiting user direction

> The Stop hook in `.claude/settings.json` greps for the literal
> heading that names the sprint focus; renaming this heading
> here pauses the autoloop without touching settings. Restore
> the sprint heading (and a goal / threads / done-criteria
> block) to resume.

**Last sprint (Studio / stationery editor at `/dashboard/invite`)
landed 2026-05-31:**
- All three open threads green: smoke flow across stationery
  types/views/drafts, AI generation paths mocked + asserted,
  Send overlay → `/api/invite/guest` → `email_sent_at` stamp.
- Studio e2e suite 41/41 passing locally. Type-check clean.
- Last commits on `main`: `bf2c3eb3` (EditionPicker prototype
  theme-pack card), `ad77fbb0` (Studio: skip the spurious
  mount-time autosave — closed the flaky AI-asset round-trip
  test). User push pending.

**To start the next sprint:** rename the heading on line 6 back
to the literal sprint-focus heading that the Stop hook greps
for, and fill in goal / direction / open threads /
counts-as-done / what-to-skip in the same shape as before.

**Both prior sprint queues are fully executed** (2026-07-08):
`docs/PERSONA-PLAN.md` S1–S9 and `docs/GRAND-PLAN-2.md` A.1–A.2 /
B.1–B.2 / C.1–C.6 are all stamped SHIPPED — nothing left to arm in
either. All four 2026-07-08 migrations (person_threads, avatar_url,
circle_invites, crew_threads) are applied to prod and recorded;
advisors clean.

**`docs/AFTERGLOW-PLAN.md` is fully executed** (2026-07-08, commit
`70713cd6`) — the post-event dashboard revamp. All four sprint
blocks (AG.1 phase spine → AG.2 afterglow home → AG.3 hero +
memory → AG.4 long view) are stamped SHIPPED. The cockpit now runs
on `src/lib/event-os/cockpit-phase.ts` (planning / final / the-day
/ afterglow / kept from the unclamped day count); WelcomeHome's
derived copy lives pure in `welcome-home-copy.ts` behind the
forbidden-strings test; `/dev/dashboard` has the four-world phase
switcher. Every dashboard-card change must keep the §5 guardrails
green (the forbidden-strings test IS the fence). Open decisions
remain in AFTERGLOW-PLAN §8 (the 45-day afterglow→kept window is a
constant in cockpit-phase.ts; per-photo focal point still
deferred). vitest 1278/1278; the PERSONA, GRAND-PLAN-2, and
AFTERGLOW queues are all fully executed.

**The next plan is written and ready: `docs/ATELIER-PLAN.md`**
(2026-07-08) — what we press, what we send, what we never fulfill.
Four audited workstreams: §1 retire Pearloom Print (a LIVE Lob +
Stripe print-and-mail pipeline ships today — the owner wants no
physical anything; press-ready PDF replaces it), §2 Studio v2
pressed from the site's real --t-* theme bag (today it's a parallel
design system with 11 documented gaps + an autosave bug), §3 the
invitation as one woven object (the batch invite email is unthemed
near-black → an unthemed /i/ page that never shows the site; no OG
on /i/ or /g/), §4 dashboard route merges (keepsakes+memory-book,
gallery+library, payments→registry, connections→weekend) + routes
reading cockpit-phase. TEN ready-to-paste sprint blocks at §6;
recommended order PR.1 → INV.1 → INV.2 → ST.1 → ST.2 → DR.1 → DR.2
→ INV.3 → ST.3 → DR.3. Paste a block over this heading to arm one.
