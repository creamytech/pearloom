## Sprint paused — awaiting user direction

> The Stop hook in `.claude/settings.json` greps for the literal
> heading that names the sprint focus; renaming this heading
> here pauses the autoloop without touching settings. Restore
> the sprint heading (and a goal / threads / done-criteria
> block) to resume.

**Last sprint (Studio / stationery editor at `/dashboard/invite`)
landed 2026-05-31:**
- All three open threads green: smoke flow across stationery
  types/views/drafts, AI generation paths mocked + asserted,
  Send overlay → `/api/invite/guest` → `email_sent_at` stamp.
- Studio e2e suite 41/41 passing locally. Type-check clean.
- Last commits on `main`: `bf2c3eb3` (EditionPicker prototype
  theme-pack card), `ad77fbb0` (Studio: skip the spurious
  mount-time autosave — closed the flaky AI-asset round-trip
  test). User push pending.

**To start the next sprint:** rename the heading on line 6 back
to the literal sprint-focus heading that the Stop hook greps
for, and fill in goal / direction / open threads /
counts-as-done / what-to-skip in the same shape as before.

**Both prior sprint queues are fully executed** (2026-07-08):
`docs/PERSONA-PLAN.md` S1–S9 and `docs/GRAND-PLAN-2.md` A.1–A.2 /
B.1–B.2 / C.1–C.6 are all stamped SHIPPED — nothing left to arm in
either. All four 2026-07-08 migrations (person_threads, avatar_url,
circle_invites, crew_threads) are applied to prod and recorded;
advisors clean.

**`docs/AFTERGLOW-PLAN.md` is fully executed** (2026-07-08, commit
`70713cd6`) — the post-event dashboard revamp. All four sprint
blocks (AG.1 phase spine → AG.2 afterglow home → AG.3 hero +
memory → AG.4 long view) are stamped SHIPPED. The cockpit now runs
on `src/lib/event-os/cockpit-phase.ts` (planning / final / the-day
/ afterglow / kept from the unclamped day count); WelcomeHome's
derived copy lives pure in `welcome-home-copy.ts` behind the
forbidden-strings test; `/dev/dashboard` has the four-world phase
switcher. Every dashboard-card change must keep the §5 guardrails
green (the forbidden-strings test IS the fence). Open decisions
remain in AFTERGLOW-PLAN §8 (the 45-day afterglow→kept window is a
constant in cockpit-phase.ts; per-photo focal point still
deferred). vitest 1278/1278; the PERSONA, GRAND-PLAN-2, and
AFTERGLOW queues are all fully executed.

**`docs/ATELIER-PLAN.md` is fully executed** (2026-07-08, ten
commits `bde6c615`…the DR.3 curation commit) — all ten §6 blocks
stamped SHIPPED. What landed: Pearloom Print retired end-to-end
(engine + routes + surfaces + pricing promise; the
no-physical-promises fence test guards the copy); the invitation is
one woven object (themed email on the SuiteTheme contract → the
guest's own per-guest card image as the hero via /api/invite-card →
?g= passport links landing on Sealed Arrival with a dated postmark;
/i/ is a legacy 301; .ics + #rsvp deep-links); Studio v2 presses
from the site's real --t-* bag ('site' sentinel palette/font,
KitFrame, shared seal/postmark envelope, real QR everywhere) and
exports a true press sheet (StudioPressSheet — 3 pages at exact
physical size, 5×7+bleed with crop marks, geometry pinned by
press-sheet-geometry tests); routes merged (payments→registry,
connections→weekend) and phase-aware (Studio/Cadence/Guests read
cockpit-phase); nav curated (Director de-promoted per §8 Q3 — Home
is the brief; ⌘K indexes the sidebar; DEPROMOTED = the true quiet
shelf: cadence/director/review/voice; Guests sub-nav gained
Threads). Open: §7 Q2 (/i/ 301 kept indefinitely), Q4 (email DNS —
owner action). vitest 1269/1269 (the retired print/SVG-serializer
suites left with their features; the press-geometry + stationery
contracts replaced them).

**`docs/TASTE-PLAN.md` is fully executed** (2026-07-08, five
commits `dad78a24`…the T.5 calm-pass commit) — the design-taste
pass from the owner's reference image, moves stolen and the
pastel-gradient skin refused. What landed: shell `<StateChip>` (one
status language — 9 surfaces migrated, 9 local helpers deleted);
the display tier (PageIntro/PLHead at 44-46px letterpress + the
shared mono-gold eyebrow); shell `<HeroPlate>`/`<PlateAction>` (the
cockpit hero generalized — Guests/Registry/Vendors/Budget/Keepsakes
each open with ONE pressed plate, real figures only); `pl-hatch`
line-screen utilities (settled things wear the press: claimed
tiles, sent phases, thanked rows, done moments); BRAND §7 copy
fixes. New chrome rules for future sessions: statuses render via
StateChip (never bare colored text), one plate per route (never
two), pattern-as-state via pl-hatch (never new patterns). vitest
1269/1269.

**`docs/STUDIO-PLAN.md` is the next plan** (authored 2026-07-09,
owner brief: replace the pastel Stamp marks + bring the Studio to
editor-level customization with paper parity). SV.0 SHIPPED same
day: the `Stamp` motif redesigned in place (`pearloom/motifs.tsx`)
from a solid pastel disc to a letterpress ink postmark — hairline
double ring, dotted inner ring, mono-caps circular text, tone
picks the ink, paper shows through; every consumer swapped
automatically; visual harness at `/dev/marks`. SV.1 SHIPPED same
day: the store's theme packs press the card (`pack:<id>` palette/
font sentinel over the pack's `--t-*` bag; Theme-packs shelf in
the Colors rail, owned/free press in one tap with faces + grain,
locked link to the store; `/dev/studio` harness). SV.2 SHIPPED
same day: paper parity (Grain-strength slider on
`--pl-texture-intensity`, six paper stocks with their own inks
incl. dark navy, edge treatments plain/hairline/double/gilded;
all persisted on manifest.studio; press sheet carries the same
sheet). SV.3–SV.6 SHIPPED same day — **the plan is fully
executed**: dated Postmark + monogram Seal marks + the Mark-ink
picker (SV.3); click-to-edit lines on the canvas + the On-the-card
show/hide group + Names size (SV.4); 10 layouts with
`recommendedStudioLayoutFor` gold-pearl picks (SV.5); the photo
back, the envelope liner + real-guest addressee, and the
`no-sticker-marks.test.ts` fence (SV.6). Open deferrals live in
each block's stamp (asset snap, per-element alignment/ink, deckle,
invite-card stock). New mark law: marks are STAMPED ink, never
pastel sticker discs — the fence test enforces it.
